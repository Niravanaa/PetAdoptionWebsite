# Pet Adoption Website
This website was created as part of an assignment for the Web Programming [SOEN287] course at Concordia University. It was built using PHP, CSS, HTML, and Bootstrap 5. The goal of this website was to create a responsive platform that allows pet owners to find or give away pets in a simple and user-friendly manner.

## Purpose
The purpose of this website was to demonstrate the knowledge and skills acquired during the Web Programming course. While Bootstrap 5 was not covered in the course, I learned it within a day to enhance the website's responsiveness and accessibility across different devices.

## How to Use
The website has a navigation bar that allows users to access the different sections of the website, including the find pet form, give pet form, login, and logout features. If you want to give away a pet on the website, you must first login and respect the format conditions.

## Contribution
If you encounter any issues while using the website, please feel free to open an issue, and I will resolve it as soon as possible. Contributions are also welcome, and you can submit a pull request if you have any suggestions for improvement.
